www.actionfigures.ro

This is my first online site, made way back in 2014 with beginner HTML and CSS skills.

Its sort of a online cemetery. I used to have a online store for action figures and related products, more than 10 years ago when i knew nothing of coding. This version is resurrected using my own code and the Internet Wayback Machine (http://archive.org/web/)
